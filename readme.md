## Rules and Principles
### General Guide
1. Always use ***WD-*** in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use 'index.html' as the filename.
3. File Structure to follow

### Seatwork 2 Guide
1. Select from Pinterest/Behance or any website that provides a complete 1 page design of website/landing page
    (full website - must consist of header, footer and some sections)
2. Create a wireframe of the website, document it same as seatwork 1
3. Formulate Emmet Codes to implement making the coding faster
4. Create a github repository(duplicate the template) and do some practice code for checking of your emmet code
    (Repository should kept empty until next meeting)
    note: add the documentation in the github repository created in step 3 and 4
5. Submit the repository link
    (in the url of same as this, is what you call a repo link. since the site is the repository of the project)
